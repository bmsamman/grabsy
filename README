This was written for the Houston Hackerspace.  Main reason at the time was to
track down things we may want to pick up from craigslist and related sites.

This bot takes a list of urls, search terms and users.  It then goes through urls, search for the terms and 
sends any updates to the users.  It takes commands via email and sends the search results via email.

This is the first iteration of the application.  Later, it will become a main engine that will be wrapped in a 
gem and then used in a web application with an admin interface.


Instructions
_____________

Read the example.config.yml for how to configure the bot.

Dependencies:
You need an inbox just for this bot for accepting commands via email.  This will go away later.
You need to install a few gems to get going, you can run this command:
gem install curb, actionpack, mail, hpricot

Once the gems are installed:
  - Copy example.config.yml and rename to config.yml
  - Change it to fit your environments
  - Run this command from the project directory:
      ruby run_job.rb
      
      
To control the bot, you can send commands to the specified retrieval server.  Commands are sent as the subject, not the body. 
The body is ignored.  DO NOT USE AN EXISTING MAIL BOX, bot will delete all emails it finds.

The commands you can send are:
  - add users <space separated receivers list>      # Example: add users joe@email.com jack@email.com john@email.com
  - remove users <space separated receivers list>   # Example: remove users joe@email.com jack@email.com john@email.com
  - add terms <space separated query words list>    # Example: add terms table pen paper
  - remove terms <space separated query words list> # Example: remove terms table pen paper
  - list                                            # Lists the current parameters
  - resend                                          # Resend the last email
